   <h2>About 📖</h2>
   
   <p>
      App that shows a random list of users, consuming an open-source API (https://randomuser.me/). The list developed with infinite scroll, displays the user's image, name and email, and brings 20 users at a time. It has a search filter, which makes it possible to search for users of each genre. When clicking on a specific user, the same user is shown on the screen with more information such as location and phone number.

 <h2>
   Learnings 🤯
   </h2>
The development of this application made me study more deeply about api requests in flutter and how to implement Material Design in the project.
It also forced me to study more about other state managers like MobX.
