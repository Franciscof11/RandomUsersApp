   <h2>About 📖</h2>
   
   <p>
      App that shows a random list of users, consuming an open-source API (https://randomuser.me/). The list developed with infinite scroll, displays the user's image, first name and email. It has a search filter, which makes it possible to search for users of each genre. When clicking on a specific user, the same user is shown on the screen with more information such as gender and full name.

 <h2>
   Learnings 🤯
   </h2>
The development of this application made me study more deeply about api requests in flutter and how to implement Material Design in the project.
It also forced me to study more about other state managers like MobX. I had to learn how to Save API data in local database serving as cache, and it helped a lot in development. I learned how to handle connection errors when querying the api, such as the device's internet falling and etc. This project also forced me to study more in depth about unit and widget tests using Mocktail .
